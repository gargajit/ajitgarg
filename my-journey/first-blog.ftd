The saying "small initiatives can bring significant career changes" rings true for my own journey. Rather than taking the 
traditional approach of applying for established and big companies, I was looking for a job that would offer me more than 
just a paycheck. I wanted to build a fulfilling career that would provide opportunities for growth and learning. 
In this post, I will share my story of starting from scratch and how seeking out unique opportunities led me to an exciting 
career path.

-- ds.h1: About me

My name is Ajit Garg, and I currently work as a DevRel Intern at FifthTry Pvt. Ltd, which I joined in the final week of 
December 2022.

Prior to this role, I had no experience working on projects or in the DevRel role. I completed my Bachelor's degree in 
Computer Science in 2015 and secured a campus placement at Accenture Solutions Pvt Ltd as a Software Test Engineer. 
However, two years later, I decided to pursue a career in Civil Services exams, but things didn't go as planned, and 
I had to start from scratch again. 
This setback only strengthened my determination to seek out new learning opportunities and explore exciting career options. 
This time I sought to join a startup to be a part of an innovative journey.

-- ds.h1: Why a startup

Based on my past experience, I was not particularly fond of working for an MNC. While there are benefits to working for an MNC 
such as job security, there is often limited learning opportunities and little input in project discussions and slow career 
progression. I don't discount the millions of people who strive for such opportunities as it can provide valuable experience 
in the short term. I had a great experience with three projects in my short career of around 2 years working in an MNC.

However, I believe that in the long run, the learning curve in such positions can become stagnant. I would merely be one among 
many, surviving on the fortunes and skills gained from the limited range of projects I was fortunate enough to work on. 
As a result, I sought a fresh and exciting career path with the potential for growth and development.

-- ds.h1: Joining FifthTry

From the very beginning, I knew I wanted to work for a startup that could provide me with both a deep and broad learning 
experience on projects, while also allowing me to offer my suggestions and participate in open discussions. My search 
for startups initially led me to explore opportunities in cities like Bangalore, Hyderabad, and Chennai.

During my search, I came across `FifthTry`, and their product immediately caught my attention. I was curious about the 
company as a whole, and what impressed me most was their commitment to continuously improving their product. While their 
documentation may have been rough around the edges, I was impressed that they had the confidence to make it publicly 
available using their own product.

What really excited me about FifthTry was their team's ambitious goal of developing a new front-end programming language, FTD, 
for the next generation of programmers. I knew this was an opportunity I couldn't pass up. And so, in the last week of 
December 2022, I joined FifthTry as a DevRel Intern. Although I had no prior experience in this specific role, I was always 
fascinated and was eager to jump in and begin contributing to the team's mission. 
One statement that particularly grabbed my attention in the documentation was:

Our language is specifically designed for human beings, not just programmers.

After exploring the documentation on FTD, I found that there were no structured learning courses available to help me 
learn the language beyond the written documentation.

I took the initiative and used the available resources to create a "Hello World" program. 
I recorded myself doing this and reached out to the CEO of FifthTry to share my progress. 
He was impressed with the video and I suggested that the company could benefit from having a video course to help others 
learn the language. He was receptive to my suggestion and offered me the role of DevRel to help create the course and promote 
the language to a wider audience. 

As an intern, I am still learning and growing in my role, but I am passionate about the 
work I am doing and excited to be part of such an innovative company.
